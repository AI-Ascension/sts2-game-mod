# Changelog

All notable changes to this target are recorded here. The repository is in foundation preparation
and has no released product behavior.

## Unreleased

- Added an offline copy of the `sts2-protocol/poc-v1` release-like artifact and a deterministic
  game-mod mapping test for state read, accepted `use_budget`, rejected zero-unit action, and one
  settled-effect witness. This remains a fake core seam with no game-runtime claim.
- Added target-local repository governance, policy-as-code, immutable-action workflows, and
  boundary documentation.
- Initialized target-owned host, bounded main-thread queue, ABI gate, HTTP-adapter, and composition
  seams with deterministic fake tests; no game behavior or public route catalog was added.
- Preserved the managed/native interop experiment as a source-only, non-production boundary.
